The datastructures module contains all classes that other modules use.

The datastructures module contains all high level abstractions representing
the aspects of a study. These structures include all abstracts that define
interfaces objects should adhere to and other classes representing the package
wide concepts of a Study, Environment, and Parameter generation.
"""
# NOTE: This module contains some ADTs which have yet to be ported. That will
# be tackled in future releases/commits.
