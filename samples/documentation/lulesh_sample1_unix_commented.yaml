# Description Block (Required)
####################################
# The description block is where the description of the study is placed. This
# section is meant primarily for documentation purposes so that when a
# spcecifcation is passed to other users they can glean a general understanding
# of what this study is meant to achieve.
#-------------------------------
# Required keys:
#   name - Name of the study
#   description - Description of what this study does.
#-------------------------------
# NOTE: You can add other keys to this block for custom documentation. Maestro
# currently only looks for the required set.

description:
    name: lulesh_sample1
    description: A sample LULESH study that downloads, builds, and runs a parameter study of varying problem sizes and iterations.

####################################
# Environment Block
####################################
# The environment block is where items describing the study's environment are
# defined. This includes static information that the study needs to know about
# and dependencies that the workflow requires for execution.
#-------------------------------
# NOTE: This block isn't strictly required as a study may not depend on anything.
####################################
env:
    #-------------------------------
    # Variables
    #-------------------------------
    # Static values that the workflow substitutes into steps and are similar in
    # concept to Unix environment variables. These variables are not dependent
    # on values in the environment and so are more portable.

    # NOTE: These values are substituted as static strings meaning that
    # variables should not be used in other variables.
    #-------------------------------
    variables:
        # OUTPUT_PATH is a keyword variable that Maestro looks for in order to
        # set a custom output path for the study workspace. This path is where
        # Maestro will place all temporary files, state files, and any output.
        # The resulting path is usually a timestamped folder within OUTPUT_PATH
        # and in this case would be
        # './sample_output/lulesh/lulesh_sample1_<timestamp>'.
        #
        # NOTE: If not specified,
        # OUTPUT_PATH is assumed to be the path where Maestro was launched from.
        # NOTE: If the '-o' flag is specified for the run subcommand, OUTPUT_PATH
        # the output path will be taken from there and will not generate a
        # timestamped path.
        OUTPUT_PATH: ./sample_output/lulesh

    #-------------------------------
    # Labels
    #-------------------------------
    # Static values that can contain variables and parameters which, like
    # variables, will be substituted into all steps. Labels are useful for
    # enforcing fixed formatting for output files, or fixed formatting for
    # components of steps which follow fixed formats.
    #-------------------------------
    labels:
        outfile: $(SIZE.label).$(ITERATIONS.label).log

    #-------------------------------
    # Dependencies
    #-------------------------------
    # Dependencies represent external artifacts that should be present before a
    # workflow can run. These are things like acquirable inputs from a directory
    # or a repository such as input files for programs, code, data, etc..

    # NOTE: Currently there are only two types of dependencies:
    # path - verifies the existence of the specified path before execution.
    # git  - clones the specified repository before execution of the study.
    #-------------------------------
    dependencies:
      git:
        - name: LULESH
          path: $(OUTPUT_PATH)
          url: https://github.com/LLNL/LULESH.git

      # NOTE: The 'depends' entry in a specification does not use parameterized
      # names -- instead Maestro attempts to infer the expansion of the graph
      # based on context via looking to see if a step uses parameters, workspaces,
      # and if the step depends on other steps that are parameterized.
      # NOTE: Second note -- this example lacks a type of step. It is possible
      # to have a step that is expanded because its dependencies have been
      # expanded. For example, if you wanted to run individual post processing
      # after each 'run-lulesh' step, you might have a step called
      # 'post-process-run' with a dependency specified as
      # 'depends: [run-lulesh]'. This notation corresponds with the concept of
      # "for each unique 'run-lulesh', there is a corresponding
      # 'post-process-run'". So for example, the expanded
      # 'run-lulesh_SIZE.10.ITER.10' would have a corresponding step named
      # 'post-process-run_SIZE.10.ITER.10' when declaring that 'post-process-run'
      # depends on 'run-lulesh' (which, to be clear, is different than depends
      # on 'run-lulesh_*' which declares dependency on ALL combinations of
      # 'run-lulesh').

####################################
# Parameter Block
####################################
# The parameter block contains all the things we'd like to vary in the study.
# Currently, there are two modes of operating in the specification:
# 1. If a parameter block is specified, the study is expanded and considered a
#   parameterized study.
# 2. If a parameter block is not specified, the study is treated as linear and
#    the resulting study is not expanded.
#
# There are three keys per parameter:
# 1. A list of values that the parameter takes.
# 2. A label that represents a "pretty printed" version of the parameter. The
#    parameter values is specfied by the '%%' moniker (for example, for SIZE --
#    when SIZE is equal to 10, the label will be 'SIZE.10'). To access the label
#    for SIZE, for example, the token '$(SIZE.label)' is used.
#    Labels can take one of two forms: A single string with the '%%' marker or
#    a list of per value labels (must be the same length as the list of values).
#
# NOTE: A specified parameter does not necessarily have to be used in every step
# or at all. If a parameter is specified and not used, it simply will not be
# factored into expansion or the naming of expanded steps or their workspaces.
# NOTE: You can also specify custom generation of parameters using a Python
# file containing the definition of a function as follows:
#
# 'def get_custom_generator():'
#
# The 'get_custom_generator' function is required to return a ParameterGenerator
# instance populated with custom filled values. In order to use the file, simply
# call Maestro using 'maestro run -p <path to py file> <specification path>'.
# For an examples of custom parameter generation, see 'samples/parameterization'
# in maestrowf repository.
