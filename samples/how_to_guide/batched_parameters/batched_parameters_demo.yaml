  # NOTE: Want to make a jinja templated version of this along with the csv generator to make testing
  #       different param counts less tedious?

      run:
          cmd: |
            echo "PARAM1: $(PARAM1);  PARAM2: $(PARAM2);  PARAM3: $(PARAM3)"

# NO PARAMETER BLOCK: SEE corresponding pgen

# ADD CLEANUP STEPS LATER -> TAR UP PARENT DIRS/WHOLE WORKSPACE TREE?
# - this starts going beyond maestro itself, but is likely good to include in the demo
# - maybe use indexer to query the status and ensure completion before tarring/up, and add param status log tracking which sets are done? -> overlaps with use case involving db's
