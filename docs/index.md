Bring rigor, reproducibility, and shareability to your computational science following the model set by the experimental disciplines.  Specify computational processes in a generalized way such that they can be documented, shared, executed, and easily reproduced.

## Why Maestro?

Maestro gives an easy path to automating and orchestrating your workflows, building upon your existing shell and batch (HPC scheduled scripts/tasks) script tasks to layer on parameterization, task dependencies, and output isolation.  Additionally, Maestro's workflow specification layer enables documenting those scripts and their interdependencies if chaining them together, and makes them more repeatable and shareable for enhanced collaboration with your peers.

## Getting Started is Quick and Easy

-   Install: build a virtual environment and install maestro into it (python 3.6 or greater)
    
    ``` console
    python -m virtualenv maestroenv
    
    source maestroenv/bin/activate
    
    pip install maestrowf
    ```
    
    And you now have the `maestro` command available in your shell

-   Create a `YAML` file named `study.yaml` and paste the following content into the file
    <!-- NOTE: add the ! after the annotations in later version of material theme to strip comments -->

    ``` yaml
    description: # (1)
        name: hello_bye_parameterized_funnel
        description: A study that says hello and bye to multiple people, and a final good bye to all.
    
    env:
        variables: # (2)
            OUTPUT_PATH: ./samples/hello_bye_parameterized_funnel
        labels: # (3)
            HELLO_FORMAT: $(GREETING)_$(NAME).txt
            BYE_FORMAT: $(FAREWELL)_$(NAME).txt
    
    study:
        - name: say-hello
          description: Say hello to someone!
          run: # (4)
              cmd: |
                echo "$(GREETING), $(NAME)!" > $(HELLO_FORMAT)
    
        - name: say-bye
          description: Say bye to someone!
          run:
              cmd: |
                echo "$(FAREWELL), $(NAME)!" > $(BYE_FORMAT)
              depends: [say-hello] # (5)
    
        - name: bye-all
          description: Say bye to everyone!
          run:
              cmd: |
                echo "Good-bye, World!" > good_bye_all.txt
              depends: [say-bye_*]
    
    global.parameters:
        NAME:  # (6)
            values: [Pam, Jim, Michael, Dwight]
            label: NAME.%%
        GREETING:
            values: [Hello, Ciao, Hey, Hi]
            label: GREETING.%%
        FAREWELL:
            values: [Goodbye, Farewell, So long, See you later]
            label: FAREWELL.%%
    ```
    
    1. Mandatory name and description fields to encourage documenting your workflows in a meaningful way
    2. Define single valued variable tokens for use in your workflow steps
    3. Define nested tokens for combining variables and parameters for more flexible token/substitution in your workflow steps
    4. `cmd` is a multline string, written in bash to harness the robust existing ecosystem of tools users are already familiar with
    5. Specify step dependencies using steps `name` to control execution order
    6. Define parameter tokens `$(NAME)` and lists of values to use in your steps such that Maestro can parameterize them for you
    
    > *PHILOSOPHY*: Maestro believes in the principle of a clearly defined process, specified as a list of tasks, that are self-documenting and clear in their intent.

-   Running the `hello_world` study is as simple as...

    ``` console
    maestro run study.yaml
    ```

-   Maestro `run` turns your workflow process specification and parameters into a task graph and executes them for you

        Maestro manages the workspaces for each parameter set for you, ensuring isolation, and capturing the generated execution scripts with parameter/variable values inserted in place of the `$(PARAMNAME)` tokens

## Maestro's Goals and Motivations
----

The primary goal of Maestro is to provide a lightweight tool for encouraging modularized workflow composition, a mental framework for thinking about these concepts, and a tool that users can flexibly utilize for a wide variety of use cases (science, software testing/deployment, and etc.). Maestro's vision aims to make steady progression towards making reproducible workflows user-friendly and easy to manage. We maintain a few high level principles:

1. Reproducibility is not free, nor is there a silver bullet to achieve it. It is a mixture of tooling, infrastructure, and best practices.
2. Workflow best practices should always be encouraged wherever possible, and enforced where reasonable.
3. It is not a workflow framework's place to force a user to use specific technologies -- a framework should couple minimally, but offer a high degree of flexibility.
4. Division of responsibility is critical. Data management, optimal performance, and orchestration are related but separate.
5. A workflow should be coherent and easy to communicate, with a framework sproviding users a mental framework to think and discuss such challenges.

We firmly believe that a user-friendly tool and environment that promotes provenance and best practices, while minimizing the effort needed for users to achieve progress, will greatly improve the quality of computational science.
